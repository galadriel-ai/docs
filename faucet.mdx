To make any transactions on our testnet, you need testnet tokens. These are used only for the purpose of development and have no real value.

Currently, the only way to receive those is via Discord. This is done to prevent abuse and make sure every developer has access to testnet tokens.

### To get testnet tokens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join Discord">
    Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bHnFgSTKrP) and go to the `#testnet-faucet` channel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post request">
    Post a message in the `#testnet-faucet` channel following this exact format, replacing `<address>` with your EVM wallet address.

    ```
    testnet-tokens <address>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

In a few seconds, you should receive the testnet tokens in your wallet.
