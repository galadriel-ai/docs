To make any transactions on our testnet, you need testnet tokens.

Currently, the only way to receive those is via Discord. This is done to prevent abuse and make sure every developer has access to testnet tokens.

### To get testnet tokens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join Discord">
    Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bHnFgSTKrP) and go to the `#testnet-tokens` channel. TODO
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post request">
    Post a message following this exact format, replacing `<address>` with your EVM address:
    ```
    TODO <address> 10
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
