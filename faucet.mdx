To make any transactions on our devnet, you need devnet tokens. These are used only for the purpose of development and have no real value.

Currently, the only way to receive those is via Discord. This is done to prevent abuse and make sure every developer has access to devnet tokens.

The faucet currently dispenses 1 GAL, allowing for about 150-200 calls to the oracle.

### To get testnet tokens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join Discord">
    Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bHnFgSTKrP) and go to the `#devnet-faucet` channel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post request">
    Post a message in the `#devnet-faucet` channel following this exact format, replacing `<address>` with your EVM wallet address.

    ```
    !faucet <address>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

In a few seconds, you should receive the devnet tokens in your wallet.
