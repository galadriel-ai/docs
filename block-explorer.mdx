Currently the only block explorer on Galadriel is [explorer.galadriel.com](https://explorer.galadriel.com), provided by the Galadriel team.

Note: the explorer may be a few minutes behind the chain, and has been reported to occasionally not showing contracts that have in fact been deployed. We are working to improve this.

The block explorer allows you to do the following and more.

- **View transactions**: See individual transactions included in each block.
- **Explore blocks**: Browse and inspect individual blocks, including details like block height, size, and timestamp.
- **Search**: Search for specific transactions, blocks, addresses, or tokens using their unique identifiers.
- **See network statistics**: Access real-time and historical data on the network.
- **Decode raw data**: Interpret raw transaction or block data.
