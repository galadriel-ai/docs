The explorer also hosts a powerful REST API providing indexed data: see the API section in the explorer sidebar.

The block explorer allows you to do the following and more.

- **View transactions**: See individual transactions included in each block.
- **Explore blocks**: Browse and inspect individual blocks, including details like block height, size, and timestamp.
- **Search**: Search for specific transactions, blocks, addresses, or tokens using their unique identifiers.
- **See network statistics**: Access real-time and historical data on the network.
- **Decode raw data**: Interpret raw transaction or block data.
