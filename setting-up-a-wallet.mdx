Galadriel should be compatible with any wallet that supports EVM. Our recommendation is to use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

Whenever you attempt to connect your wallet to a dApp running on Galadriel network, you should be automatically prompted to add the Galadriel network to your app. Alternatively, you could connect manually as described below.

### Connect manually

To connect to the Galadriel devnet manually, follow the guide to [add a custom network RPC](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC) and use the following settings:

* Network Name: **Galadriel Testnet**
* New RPC URL: https://testnet.galadriel.com
* Chain ID: **696969**
* Currency Symbol: **GAL**
* Block Explorer URL: https://explorer.galadriel.com
