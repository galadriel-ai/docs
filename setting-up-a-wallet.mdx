Galadriel should be compatible with any wallet that supports EVM. Our recommendation is to use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

Whenever you attempt to connect your wallet to a dApp running on Galadriel network, you should be automatically prompted to add the Galadriel network to your app. Alternatively, you could connect manually as described below.

<Note>
If you previously connected to Galadriel Testnet, you need to migrate to the new network -- Testnet will be shut down on 01 Apr 2024.

To migrate your wallet, reset your account activity in your wallet. If you are using Metamask, follow [these instructions](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891-How-to-clear-your-account-activity-reset-account).

To migrate your application, make sure you are using the correct RPC URL (**devnet**.galadriel.com) and [Oracle address](/oracle-address.mdx).
</Note>

### Connect manually

To connect to the Galadriel devnet manually, follow the guide to [add a custom network RPC](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC) and use the following settings:

* Network Name: **Galadriel Devnet**
* New RPC URL: https://devnet.galadriel.com
* Chain ID: **696969**
* Currency Symbol: **GAL**
* Block Explorer URL: https://explorer.galadriel.com
