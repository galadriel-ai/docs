#### Rate limit headers

We set the following `x-ratelimit` headers to inform you on current rate limits applicable to you.

The following headers are set (values are illustrative):
| Header | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- |--- |
| retry-after | 2 | Seconds to wait until retrying* |
| x-ratelimit-limit-requests | 28800 | Requests per day allowed |
| x-ratelimit-limit-tokens | 40000 | Tokens per minute allowed |
| x-ratelimit-remaining-requests | 123 | Requests remaining for the day |
| x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens | 1337 | Tokens remaining for this minute |
| x-ratelimit-reset-requests | 1337s | Seconds until the daily rate limit resets |
| x-ratelimit-reset-tokens | 1s | Seconds until the minute based token limit resets |

\* The `retry-after` header is only returned if the response status code is 429 and the request was rate limited
