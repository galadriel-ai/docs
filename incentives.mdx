# Earn a stake in ETH for AI

First 6 months network participants that run a node to provide GPU(s) to the network for LLM inference will be included in daily stake rewards. 

## Your daily stake depends on the following 

1. Uptime of the node
2. Successful inferences made
3. Performance of the node 
    1. Throughput (i.e. H100 should be rewarded more points vs GTX 3080)
    2. Latency/network performance - i.e. avg how fast inference served
