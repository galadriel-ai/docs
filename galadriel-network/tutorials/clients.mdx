## What is a Client?

A Client connects your agent to real-world input and output sources. It delivers [Messages](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/galadriel/blob/main/galadriel/entities.py#L11) to your agent and routes responses to their destination.

A Client can be one (or both) of:

- **Input (AgentInput)**: Provides messages to the agent.
- **Output (AgentOutput)**: Sends the agent's responses to their destination.

This design allows your agent to integrate seamlessly with a wide range of sources, from scheduled tasks (like cron jobs) to interactive platforms (like Discord bots).

## Adding Clients to Your Agent

### 1. Prerequisites

If you donâ€™t have an already working agent built with Galadriel, please go through the [quick start](https://www.notion.so/Quick-Start-Reviewed-18c52f74d7f6801296a8d2c098d3913f?pvs=21).

### 2. Gradio Client Example

Clients connect to [AgentRuntime](https://www.notion.so/Agent-Runtime-In-Review-18c52f74d7f680439bcac34e51a0e811?pvs=21), which manages how the agent processes inputs and returns results.

```python
import asyncio
from galadriel import AgentRuntime, CodeAgent
from galadriel.clients import GradioClient
from galadriel.core_agent import LiteLLMModel, DuckDuckGoSearchTool

model = LiteLLMModel(model_id="gpt-4o", api_key="<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>")

agent = CodeAgent(model=model, tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()])

gradio_client = GradioClient()

runtime = AgentRuntime(
    agent=agent,
    inputs=[gradio_client],
    outputs=[gradio_client],
)

asyncio.run(runtime.run())
```

### 3. Supported Clients (or Build Your Own)

We currently provide built-in support for:

- Discord
- Telegram
- Gradio
- Terminal
- Cron

- Twitter

Visit our [Clients](https://www.notion.so/Clients-in-review-19652f74d7f68041be7ec44585963dd9?pvs=21) to learn more about using these clients or creating your own.

## Conclusion

Clients allow you to plug your agent into the real world with minimal effort. Need an AI that interacts via Discord, Slack, email, or webhooks? Just write a Client that conforms to `AgentInput` and `AgentOutput`, and you're good to go.
