## What is a Tool?

A tool is a predefined function available for an agent to use when it decides to. It augments the LLM model used by the agent to interact with external data sources, APIs, or programs. For example, a tool can fetch the weather in London or sign and submit a transaction to Ethereum to update a portfolio.

Every tool extends the [Tool](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/tools.py#L83) class and specifies:

- A `name` used in the prompt for an agent.
- A `description` of what the tool does, the inputs it expects, and the output(s) it will return.
- A type of tool `output`.
- `Inputs` it expects.

## Adding Tool-Use to Your Agent

Tools are passed to the `agent` object. The agent can run with any number of tools, including no tools at all.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure youâ€™ve gone through the quick start guide and have the development environment set up.

### 2. Example Usage

```python
from galadriel.tools.web3 import dexscreener

agent = CodeAgent(
    model=model,
    tools=[dexscreener.fetch_market_data],
)
```

In this example, `dexscreener.fetch_market_data` is a tool available in `galadriel.tools.web3`.

Complete example code is [here](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/galadriel/tree/main/examples/basic-web3).

### 3. Out-of-the-Box Tools by Galadriel

Visit the [Tools Integration](https://www.notion.so/Tools-In-Review-18f52f74d7f680c48c2ef61ab4afff12?pvs=21) page to explore our growing list of supported tools and learn how to integrate them. You can also leverage tools from [Composio](https://composio.dev/) and [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools/).

### 4. Build Your Own Tools

You can also build your own tools. There are two ways to do it.

#### 1. For Simpler Tools, Use the `@tool` Annotation

```python
from galadriel.core_agent import tool

@tool
def get_time(location: str) -> str:
    """
    Get the current time in the given location.
    Args:
        location: the location
    """
    return f"The time in {location} is {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}"
```

#### 2. For More Complex Tools, Extend the `Tool` Class

Extend the `Tool` class similarly to [RetrieverTool](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/galadriel/blob/main/galadriel/tools/retriever.py).

#### 3. Want Your Tool in the Galadriel Framework?

Contact our developers on Discord to integrate your tool into the Galadriel framework out of the box.

## Conclusion

Tools significantly expand an agentâ€™s capabilities, enabling interaction with external systems and data sources. Whether using built-in tools, third-party integrations, or custom implementations, tools make AI agents more powerful and versatile.
