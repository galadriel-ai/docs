title: Payments

Agents can optionally be monetized using a pricing model. If a pricing object is provided, the runtime ensures that the client submitting a request has transferred the required funds on the Solana blockchain before processing the request.

The `Runtime` also enables configuring payments to the Agent, to get paid for the tasks performed, by checking if the message from the client includes a transaction signature on the Solana blockchain, transferring enough funds to the Agent.

To enable pricing, all that is needed is giving the Runtime a `Pricing` object that contains the payment size needed in SOL, and the Agent wallet address:

```python
pricing = Pricing(
    wallet_address=agent_wallet_address,
    cost=0.1, # 0.1 SOL
)

runtime = AgentRunTime(
	inputs=[my_client],
	outputs=[my_client],
	agent=agent,
	pricing=pricing,
)
```

When pricing is forwarded, the runtime

- checks if the incoming messages from the `inputs` contain a Solana transaction signature. The signatures can be either just a signature string or a link to Solscan.
- Verifies that the transaction transferred the required amount of SOL.
- Only forwards the `Message` to the agent if the payment is valid.
