## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through building a multi-agent system using the Galadriel framework. Multi-agent systems enable several agents to work 
together on a task, often yielding better performance than a single monolithic agent. By dividing responsibilities among agents, you can achieve 
efficient specialization.

## Prerequisites

- Python >=3.10
- Galadriel installed (see [Quickstart](/galadriel-network/get-started/quickstart) for installation instructions)
- OpenAI API key set in your environment

## Step 1: Define the Agents

In this example, we will create a manager-worker pattern with two agents:

-   **Manager Agent**: This agent receives user queries and coordinates with the worker agent.
-   **Web Search Agent**: This specialized worker agent uses the `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` to perform web searches.

Create two CodeAgents:

### Web Search Agent (Worker)

This agent is responsible for performing web searches based on queries provided by the manager agent.

### Manager Agent

This agent receives the initial query and orchestrates the workflow, delegating web search tasks to the `managed_web_agent` when necessary.

## Step 2: Set up the Client

Create a `SimpleMessageClient` to provide input to the manager agent. This client will simulate user queries.

## Step 3: Configure the Agent Runtime

The `AgentRuntime` manages the execution of the agents, connecting the input client, manager agent, and output client.

## Step 4: Run the Multi-Agent System

Start the agent runtime using asyncio:

## Complete Code

Here's the complete code for the multi-agent system:

## Step 5: Run the agent

To execute the multi-agent system, save the code above in `agent.py` file.
Make sure to create `template.env` file and set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable inside it.
Finally, run the script:

## Architecture

The example showcases a hierarchical agent system using the manager-worker pattern:

-   The **Manager Agent** receives user queries and delegates tasks to the **Web Search Agent** using specified tools.
-   The **Web Search Agent** executes web searches and returns the findings to the manager agent.
-   The **AgentRuntime** connects all the agents to input and output `Clients`, and takes care of the agent execution lifecycle.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to build a multi-agent system using Galadriel, leveraging the `CodeAgent` and `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` to create a 
manager-worker architecture. By specializing and delegating tasks to individual agents, you can achieve efficient and scalable solutions.
