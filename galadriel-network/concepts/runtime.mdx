## What is an Agent Runtime?

For an agent to be truly autonomous, it must operate continuously, ready to process new requests in real time. This is precisely  the role of `AgentRuntime`. It is the core orchestration layer that manages agent execution, ensuring that messages are processed efficiently while maintaining the agent’s state.

## How It Works

At a high level, the `Agent Runtime` follows this execution loop:

1. **Receive a [Message](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/galadriel/blob/main/galadriel/entities.py#L11)** – An input client sends a message to the runtime.
2. **Process the [Message](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/galadriel/blob/main/galadriel/entities.py#L11)** – The agent receives and handles the request.
3. **Send the Response** – The agent's output is forwarded to the appropriate client.
4. **Repeat** – The runtime continuously handles incoming messages in a loop.

`AgentRuntime` interface is defined as follows

```python
class AgentRuntime:
    def __init__(
            self,
            # Any number of input Clients
            inputs: List[AgentInput],
            # Any number of output Clients
            outputs: List[AgentOutput],
            # The agent to run
            agent: Agent,
            # optional short term memory - more on that later
            short_term_memory: Optional[ShortTermMemory] = None,
            # optional pricing - more on that later
            pricing: Optional[Pricing] = None,
    ):
        ...
```

The `Agent Runtime` **can handle any number of input/output clients concurrently, making it easy to implement all kinds of agents that can handle various workflows.

## Using `AgentRuntime`

Based on the interface above, here’s an example of how the runtime is created.

```python
runtime = AgentRunTime(
	inputs=[cron, discord], # Specify which input clients should trigger agent execution
	outputs=[twitter], # Specify which output clients should publish agent's results
	agent=agent, # Specify which agent should be executed
)
```

The creation of the runtime is lightweight as it doesn’t start listening to inputs nor trigger the agent execution. In order to start the runtime process, its `AgentRuntime#run` must be called.

```python
asyncio.run(runtime.run())
```

Note that in order to run infinitely and asynchronously respond to inputs, `AgentRuntime#run` is `async` function. Therefore, it has to be passed to `asyncio.run`.

## Conclusion

The `Agent Runtime` is the backbone of autonomous agent execution, enabling seamless integration and scalability. It’s main responsibilities are:

- **Orchestration** – the runtime ties the agent execution flow together. It enables Agents to run indefinitely and autonomously. Handles multiple concurrent clients
- **Validation -** manages the types of messages coming in and making sure they are valid
- **Integration** – Supports multiple input/output sources, enabling build complex agents. It can be extended with additional components like memory and pricing
