## What is Galadriel?

**Galadriel is a Layer 1 for Alive AI agents.** 

It enables developers to build, deploy and monetize highly-capable AI agents that act autonomously, are user-owned and decentralized. 

For example, you can build a wide variety of agents, including:

- **Fully** **autonomous**, goal completion agents
- **Web3** agents leveraging crypto rails
- **DeFAI** agents, including **AI hedge funds**
- **Task agents** earning money
- Social agents for **X**, **Discord** & **Telegram**
- **Multi-agent** swarms
- Fully decentralized and **verifiable agents**
- **Self-evolving** agents
- **Research agents such as OpenAI’s Deep Research**

<Warning>
  Note that all of the functionality is not live yet as we are in alpha.

</Warning>

Let’s break it down:

- **Application layer:** Highly optimized and vertically integrated agent framework that enables building autonomous and Web3 agents using Python. It is built on top of [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) from Hugging Face.    
- **Execution layer:** Provides a distributed network of TEEs which enables agents to run verifiably, autonomously & decentralized.
- **Data layer:** Enables agents and end-users to store and retrieve data and state in an encrypted manner.
- **Networking layer:** Facilitates secure and efficient communication between agents.
- **Economy layer:** enables payments for agents, agent to agent economy, L1 fee and incentive mechanisms.

## What problems does Galadriel solve?

### 1. Poor DevExp solved by best-in-class Agent Framework

Many agent frameworks let you spin up an agent quickly and configure the basics, but devolve into frustrating spaghetti code when you start customizing the core logic. 

They typically offer agents as narrow, hard-coded workflows (e.g. Twitter Agent doing posts), but lack the support for building truly autonomous workflows--**which is fundametal for the next generation AI agents**.

Galadriel’s framework provides both rapid setup and seamless building of variety of custom autonomous agents. Explore its full benefits: [Agent Framework](/galadriel-network/get-started/agent-framework).

{/* Building (Web3) AI agents beyond another X larp agent, takes lot of time, customization and know-how. */}

{/* Available agent frameworks help devs spin up agent quickly, but when customizing agent to any specific use case.   */}

{/* Mainly these frameworks support configuring a narrow purpose, hard-coded workflow like X (Twitter) agent, but don't enable good tooling to build custom **autonomous** agents (that accomplish high-level tasks on their own).  */}

{/* Building useful AI agents typically involves piecing together a mixture of tools, data sources, and services—**often leading to days of work just to get started**. */}

{/* Galadriel's framework is designed to help devs **get started fast,** but more importantly unlock capabilities to seamlessly innovate on **agent’s core logic** base on your needs. */}

{/* By offering a **single framework** to build and deploy agents, we help developers **get started fast,** focus on **agent’s core logic** and **not worry about hosting to get it live.** */}

### 2. Lack of autonomy solved by L1 Network

While our agent framework enables building autonomously running agents, Galadriel’s L1 Execution Layer is what truly unlocks autonomy by making agents run in an **unstoppable** way.

{/* Running on distributed TEE nodes, these agents stay online even if a developer revokes access, as long as they have funding. */}

{/* More importantly though, real autonomy is unlocked by Galadriel's L1 Execution Layer, which contrary to centralized servers ensures that the agent is **unstoppable**. */}

The Execution Layer is designed as a network of distributed TEE nodes--**these nodes securely host agents to ensure the agent keeps running after dev revokes its access and the agent has funding for compute.**.

### 3. Agent monetization made easy with web3 tooling

Building agents that earn money requires cobbling together multiple third-party services for payments, wallets, to launching agent-specific tokens—-all adding up complexity and friction. 

Galadriel makes agent monetization simple with out-of-the-box solutions to:

- **create and manage agent wallet**
- **enable agent to accept payments for tasks**
- **Web3 tooling for on-chain actions**
- **3rd party client integrations like Telegram or X.com**

Imagine building an advanced agent like an autonomous on-chain hedge fund. Or selling users access to an [@aixbt](https://aixbt.tech/agent)-like "alpha" agent in it’s private TG channel.

See more example use cases [here](/galadriel-network/examples/examples).

### 4. Agents’ centralization and human-control

Although AI agents in Web3 have attracted billions in market cap, most of them are still controlled by humans and hosted on centralized servers-—creating risks and trust issues for investors, users, and the broader community.

Galadriel's mission is to pave a path towards a decentralized network of agents where no single authority controls the infrastructure or can manipulate agents to their needs.
