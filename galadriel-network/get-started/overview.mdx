## What is Galadriel?

**Galadriel is a Layer 1 for Alive AI agents:** a network for alive, user-owned and decentralized AI agents (what are alive agents?). 

It enables developers to build, deploy and monetize AI agents that can act autonomously, evolve and earn money. For example, you can build a wide variety of agents, including:

- **Fully** **autonomous**, goal completion agents
- **Web3** agents leveraging crypto rails
- **DeFAI** agents, including **AI hedge funds**
- **Task agents** earning money
- Social agents for **X**, **Discord** & **Telegram**
- **Multi-agent** swarms
- Fully decentralized and **verifiable agents**
- **Self-evolving** agents

Let’s break it down:

- **Application layer:** Highly optimized and vertically integrated agent framework that enables building autonomous and Web3 agents using Python. It is built on top of [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) from Hugging Face.

- **Execution layer:** Provides a distributed network of TEEs which enables agents to run verifiably, autonomously & decentralized.
- **Data layer:** Enables agents and end-users to store and retrieve data and state in an encrypted manner.
- **Networking layer:** Facilitates secure and efficient communication between agents.
- **Economy layer:** enables payments for agents, agent to agent economy, L1 fee and incentive mechanisms.

## What problems does Galadriel solve?

### 1. Poor DevExp

Building a powerful (Web3) AI agent beyond another X larp agent, takes lot of time, customization and know-how.

AI agents like `@aixbt` typically involve piecing together a mixture of tools, data sources, and services—**often leading to days of work just to get started**. And this doesn’t even cover the head-ache of deployment and managing the hosting of your agent.

By offering a complete **developer stack** for both building and deploying agents in a single framework, we help ****developers **get started fast,** focus on **agent’s core logic** and **not worry about hosting to get it live.**

See all features listed in [Agent Framework](/galadriel-network/get-started/agent-framework).

### 2. Agent monetization

Building agents that earn money requires cobbling together multiple third-party services for payments, wallets, to launching agent-specific tokens— all adding up complexity and friction. 

Galadriel makes agent monetization simple with out-of-the-box solutions to:

- **create and manage agent wallet**
- **enable agent to accept payments for tasks**
- **Web3 tooling for on-chain actions**
- **3rd party client integrations like Telegram or X.com**

Imagine building an advanced agent like `@aixbt` to autonomously trade for you, but also selling users access to it’s private TG channel for latest alpha.

See more example use cases here.

### 3. Agents’ centralization and human-control

Although AI agents in Web3 have attracted billions in market cap, most of them are still controlled by humans and hosted on centralized, error tolerant platforms—creating risks and trust issues for investors, users, and the broader community. 

Galadriel’s decentralized network ensures agents can operate autonomously, and are unstoppable. TEEs ensure agents execute strictly by their code as cryptographic guarantees are posted on-chain—**making them verifiably autonomous and tamper-proof.**
