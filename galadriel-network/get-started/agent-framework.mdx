## Problems with existing frameworks

While our team built [Daige](https://www.daige.ai/), we tried every major Web3 agent framework and ran into well-known issues most of them have:

1. **Rigid & Complex**: Too many layers of abstraction, making them hard to debug and extend.
2. **Workflow-Focused**: They emphasize workflows over autonomous, goal-solving agents.
3. **Overgrown & Hard to Customize**: Production often requires rewriting the whole framework from scratch.
4. **Weak MVP Focus**: They can spin up basic agents quickly but struggle with truly powerful ones.

We knew creating a world-class agent framework from scratch would take serious effort and R&D. That’s why our solution is built on [**smolagents**](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) from Hugging Face—a lightweight, powerful library that enables autonomous agents.

## Galadriel framework

We believe that agent development requires a robust, vertically integrated stack — a strategy proven by successful ecosystems such as Swift & iOS and Rust/Anchor & Solana.
Following this principle, Galadriel's framework is highly optimized for and tightly integrated with Galadriel L1.

The framework’s design and development are guided by the following core principles:

1. **Simplicity** - Minimal abstractions, with ~1,000 lines of agent logic.
2. **Autonomous Agents** - Enables agents to plan and control their own workflows.
3. **Broad Tool Support** - Integrates with [LangChain](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.Tool.from_langchain), [Anthropic's MCP](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.ToolCollection.from_mcp), and more.
4. **Web3 Functionalities** - Provides out-of-the-box support for on-chain and off-chain tools, wallet integration, and payments.
5. **Most used Clients** - Integrates your agent with X, TG, Discord, and other main clients.
6. **Model-Agnostic** – Works seamlessly with any LLM, whether local or hosted.
7. **Modality-Agnostic** – Supports text, vision, video, and audio inputs.
