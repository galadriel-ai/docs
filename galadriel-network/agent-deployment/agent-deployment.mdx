title: "Deploying Agents to Galadriel Network"
---

This guide covers how to deploy your agents to the Galadriel network using the Galadriel CLI. The CLI provides a comprehensive set of commands to manage the entire agent lifecycle - from initialization and development to deployment and monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your agent, ensure you have:

1. Installed the Galadriel package
2. Docker installed and running (for build/publish operations)
3. A Galadriel API key
4. Docker Hub credentials (for publishing images)

## Installation

Install the Galadriel package using pip:

```bash
pip install galadriel
```

## Agent Lifecycle Management

### Initializing a New Agent

Create a new agent project with all necessary files and structure:

```bash
galadriel agent init
```

This interactive command will prompt you for:
- Agent name

The command creates:
- Basic agent structure
- Docker configuration
- Environment files
- Required Python files

### Building Your Agent

Build the Docker image for your agent:

```bash
galadriel agent build [--image-name NAME]
```

Options:
- `--image-name`: Name for the Docker image (default: "agent")

### Publishing Your Agent

Push the agent's Docker image to Docker Hub:

```bash
galadriel agent publish [--image-name NAME]
```

Options:
- `--image-name`: Name for the Docker image (default: "agent")

### Deploying Your Agent

Build, publish and deploy the agent to the Galadriel platform:

```bash
galadriel agent deploy [--image-name NAME] [--skip-build] [--skip-publish]
```

Options:
- `--image-name`: Name for the Docker image (default: "agent")
- `--skip-build`: Skip building the Docker image
- `--skip-publish`: Skip publishing the Docker image to Docker Hub

<Info>
  When you deploy an agent, you'll receive an agent ID. Save this ID as you'll need it for future operations like checking state or updating the agent.
</Info>

### Updating an Existing Agent

Update an agent that's already deployed on the Galadriel platform:

```bash
galadriel agent update --agent-id AGENT_ID [--image-name NAME]
```

Required:
- `--agent-id`: ID of the agent to update

Options:
- `--image-name`: Name for the Docker image (default: "agent")

### Monitoring Your Agent

Retrieve the current state of a deployed agent:

```bash
galadriel agent state --agent-id AGENT_ID
```

Required:
- `--agent-id`: ID of the deployed agent

### Listing All Deployed Agents

Get information about all your deployed agents:

```bash
galadriel agent list
```

### Removing a Deployed Agent

Remove a deployed agent from the Galadriel platform:

```bash
galadriel agent destroy AGENT_ID
```

Required:
- `AGENT_ID`: ID of the agent to destroy

## Configuration Files

### .env

This file contains environment variables required for deployment:

```
DOCKER_USERNAME=your_username
DOCKER_PASSWORD=your_password
GALADRIEL_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys and credentials secure. Never commit this file to version control.
</Warning>

### .agents.env

This file contains environment variables for the agent runtime:

```
# Example
LLM_API_KEY=your_key
LLM_MODEL=your_model
SOLANA_KEY_PATH=path_to_your_solana_key
```

<Warning>
  Do not include deployment credentials in this file. This file is for agent-specific configuration only.
</Warning>

## Wallet Management

For agents that interact with the Solana blockchain, the Galadriel CLI provides wallet management commands.

### Creating a Wallet

Create a new Solana wallet:

```bash
galadriel wallet create [--path PATH]
```

Options:
- `--path`: Path to save the wallet key file (default: "~/.galadriel/solana/default_key.json")

### Importing an Existing Wallet

Import an existing wallet:

```bash
galadriel wallet import [--private-key KEY] [--path PATH]
```

Options:
- `--private-key`: Private key of the wallet to import in JSON format
- `--path`: Path to the wallet key file to import

<Info>
  You must provide either `--private-key` or `--path`, but not both.
</Info>

### Requesting an Airdrop

Request an airdrop of 0.001 SOL to your Solana wallet:

```bash
galadriel wallet airdrop
```

## Deployment Example

Here's a complete example of creating and deploying a new agent:

```bash
# Initialize new agent
galadriel agent init

# Build and deploy
galadriel agent deploy --image-name my-first-agent

# Check agent status
galadriel agent state --agent-id your-agent-id
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Ensure Docker is running before using build/publish commands
2. Verify your Galadriel API key is valid
3. Check that your Docker Hub credentials are correct
4. Confirm your `.env` and `.agents.env` files are properly configured
5. Make sure you have necessary permissions on Docker Hub
