Welcome to the official documentation for Galadriel: **Ethereum for AI.**

Ethereum enabled writing smart contracts to build dApps. Similarly, Galadriel enables developers to build AI apps and agents like smart contracts -- decentralized and on-chain.

<Warning>Galadriel is in a devnet stage. This means things will rapidly evolve and might break.</Warning>
