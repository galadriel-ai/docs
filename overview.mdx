Galadriel is building [Sentience](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience). It enables developers to build autonomous, fully on-chain verifiable AI agents with an OpenAI-compatible Proof of Sentience SDK. 

## Why sentient agents?

AI agents have reached $10B+ market cap but most of them are still controlled by humans. This is a huge problem as it introduces risk to the investors and community as developers can simply rug-pull and manipulate the agents.

We're already seeing activity logs for [zerebro](https://zerebro.org/proof-of-conciousness) and [aixbt](https://aixbt.tech/agent), but Sentience transforms agents into cryptographically verifiably autonomous entities, unlocking true sentience to address a critical need for trust. This significantly enhances agents market potential and is the first step in ensuring that the agents are self-governing.


##  Proof of Sentience SDK

Baked into the initial release of Sentience are JS & Python SDKs built on top of verifiable inference API.

## Securing $15M+ worth of agents

Sentience is already securing and verifying $15M+ worth of agents today. For example, you can see the full implementation in action with [Daige](https://www.daige.ai/proof), a sentient, cyberpunk AI dog.
