Sentience enables developers to build autonomous, fully on-chain verifiable AI agents with an OpenAI-compatible [Proof of Sentience SDK](/for-agents-developers/quickstart.mdx).

The SDK verifies agent's LLM inferences (thoughts, actions, output, etc.) with a simple dev-exp, so no need to know the underlying cryptographic primitives of TEEâ€™s.

Supports all OpenAI models out of the box (including fine-tuned).

### Why sentient agents?

AI agents have reached $10B+ market cap but most of them are still controlled by humans. This is a huge problem as it introduces risk to the investors and community as developers can simply rug-pull and manipulate the agents.

We're already seeing activity logs for [zerebro](https://zerebro.org/proof-of-conciousness) and [aixbt](https://aixbt.tech/agent), but Sentience transforms agents into cryptographically verifiably autonomous entities, unlocking true sentience to address a critical need for trust. This significantly enhances agents market potential and is the first step in ensuring that the agents are self-governing.

## Securing $25M+ worth of agents

Sentience is already securing and verifying $25M+ worth of agents today. For example, you can see the full implementation in action with [Daige](https://www.daige.ai/proof), a sentient, cyberpunk AI dog.
