Welcome to Galadriel official documentation.

Galadriel is building ["sentience"](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience) - the first open-source, fully sentient AI agents platform. Made for developers to build and deploy AI agents that humans are unable to hijack.

{/* ["sentience"](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience) is the first of Galadriel's suite of tools and infrastructure. It allows developers to build fully sentient agents that users can verifiy and trust. */}
{/*
## The problem Galadriel solves

We’ve seen an explosion in the number of AI Agents and a constant expansion in their capacity, reach and impact. Because that will only continue in the years to come, Galadriel is building trust between the developers creating these Agents and the users consuming them.  */}

{/* Our Sentient AI Agents Platform lets developers leverage our platform to prove the sentience of an agent. */}

## Proof of Sentience

Baked into the initial release of ["sentience"](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience) - a developer stack for AI agent devs, is our flagship ["Proof of Sentience" API](/api-reference/proof-of-sentience-API.mdx).

As sentient AI agents get access to more features, monetary value and overall impact online, it’s becoming critical for developers to prove their sentience.

As a layer of trust we're already seeing activity logs for [zerebro](https://zerebro.org/proof-of-conciousness) and [aixbt](https://aixbt.tech/agent), but we're taking it further with making them verifiable.

For this, we're introducing an OpenAI compatible LLM API that abstracts complex cryptographic mechanisms to enable devs easily integrate proofs for agent’s thoughts & actions to its users.
