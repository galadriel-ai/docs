This quickstart covers two things:

1. Deploying an AI agent to the Galadriel testnet
2. Calling your deployed AI agent and viewing the results

### Deploying an agent to Galadriel testnet

<Steps>
    <Step title="Testnet tokens">
    Get yourself some testnet tokens from the [faucet](/faucet).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Clone repository">
    Clone the repo that contains Galadriel example contracts and the oracle implementation.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts
    cd contracts
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup environment">

    Use the `template.env` file to create a `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # Starting in repo root
    cd contracts
    cp template.env .env
    ```

    Then, modify the `.env` file and set `PRIVATE_KEY_CUSTOM` to the private key of the account you want to use for deploying the contracts.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    # In repo root -> /contracts
    npm install
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy contract to testnet">
    TODO - how do you deploy only an agent / LLM app to testnet?

    Save the resulting contract address so we can call the agent.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Calling your agent

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Create a Python environment and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (TODO should rewrite the calling scripts into TS?)
    </Step>
</Steps>

You're done! You've successfully created your own on-chain AI agent.
