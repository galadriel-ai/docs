This quickstart covers two things:

1. Deploying an AI app to the Galadriel devnet
2. Calling your deployed AI app and viewing the results

### Prerequisites

* A Galadriel devnet [account](/setting-up-a-wallet). We recommend creating a new EVM account for development purposes.
* Some [devnet tokens](/faucet) on the account you are using.
* `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.

### Deploying a contract on Galadriel devnet

<Steps>
    <Step title="devnet tokens">
    Get yourself some devnet tokens from the [faucet](/faucet).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Clone repository">
    Clone the repo that contains Galadriel example contracts and the oracle implementation.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts
    cd contracts/contracts
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup environment">

    Use the `template.env` file to create a `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # Starting in repo root
    cp template.env .env
    ```

    Then, modify the `.env` file:
    * Set `PRIVATE_KEY_CUSTOM` to the private key of the account you want to use for deploying the contracts to Galadriel devnet.
    * Set `ORACLE_ADDRESS` to the [current devnet oracle address](/oracle-address) provided by Galadriel team: **{oracleAddress}**.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    # In repo root -> /contracts
    npm install
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy contract to devnet">
    The [quickstart contract](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Quickstart.sol) can be deployed with a [simple script](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/blob/main/contracts/scripts/deployQuickstart.ts):

    ```bash
    npm run deployQuickstart
    ```

    The output of the script will show the deployed contract address. Store this and export it in terminal to call the contract later:

    ```bash
    # Replace with your own contract address
    export QUICKSTART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Calling your contract

Prerequisites:
* You've deployed the quickstart contract in the previous step, and stored the contract address.

<Steps>
    <Step name="Make a call to the contract">

    Execute the following command to run a [script](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/blob/main/contracts/scripts/deployQuickstart.ts) that calls the deployed contract:

    ```bash
    npm run callQuickstart
    ```

    The script will interactively ask for the input (DALL-E prompt: what image should be generated) and then call the contract with the input. The output, when ready, will be printed to the console.

    If this step fails, make sure you have set the `QUICKSTART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable to the address of your deployed contract.
    </Step>
</Steps>

You're done! You've successfully created and called your own on-chain AI app.

What's next?

* Continue developing your own contracts. See the [contracts readme](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/tree/main/contracts) and the [Solidity reference](/solidity-reference) for more.
* Read [how Galadriel works](/how-it-works).
* Explore [use cases](/use-cases) for inspiration and examples of full dApps including a frontend.
