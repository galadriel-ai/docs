This quickstart covers two things:

1. Deploying an AI agent to the Galadriel testnet
2. Calling your deployed AI agent and viewing the results

### Prerequisites

* A Galadriel testnet [account](/setting-up-a-wallet). We recommend creating a new EVM account for development purposes.
* Some [testnet tokens](/faucet) on the account you are using.
* `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.

### Deploying a contract on Galadriel testnet

<Steps>
    <Step title="Testnet tokens">
    Get yourself some testnet tokens from the [faucet](/faucet).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Clone repository">
    Clone the repo that contains Galadriel example contracts and the oracle implementation.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts
    cd contracts
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup environment">

    Use the `template.env` file to create a `.env` file:

    ```bash
    # Starting in repo root
    cd contracts
    cp template.env .env
    ```

    Then, modify the `.env` file:
    * Set `PRIVATE_KEY_CUSTOM` to the private key of the account you want to use for deploying the contracts to Galadriel testnet.
    * Set `ORACLE_ADDRESS` to the [current testnet oracle address](/oracle) provided by Galadriel team.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    # In repo root -> /contracts
    npm install
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Deploy contract to testnet">
    The [quickstart contract](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Quickstart.sol)) can be deployed with a [simple script](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/blob/main/contracts/scripts/deployQuickstart.ts):

    ```bash
    npm run deployQuickstart
    ```

    The output of the script will show the deployed contract address. Store this to call the contract later:

    ```bash
    # Replace with your own contract address
    export QUICKSTART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Calling your agent

Prerequisites:
* You've deployed the quickstart contract in the previous step, and the the contract address.

<Steps>
    <Step name="Make a call to the contract">

    Execute the following command to run a [script](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/blob/main/contracts/scripts/deployQuickstart.ts) that calls the deployed contract:

    ```bash
    yarn hardhat run scripts/callQuickstart.ts --network galadriel
    ```

    (TODO if fails make sure contract address env is set)
    </Step>
    <Step name="Check the output">
        TODO - how to see output in explorer
    </Step>
</Steps>

You're done! You've successfully created your own on-chain AI app.

What's next?

* Continue developing your own contracts. See the [contracts readme](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/tree/main/contracts) and the [Solidity reference](/solidity-reference) for more.
* Read [how Galadriel works](/how-it-works).
* Explore [use cases](/use-cases) for inspiration and examples of full dApps including a frontend.
