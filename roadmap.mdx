    <Step title="Devnet: live as of 4.24">
        Galadriel's devnet is out now. During devnet you can build working on-chain AI agents and applications. What can you expect during devnet:
        * We are iterating the product fast along with user needs so things are changing rapidly;
        * We expect to make many big architectural changes during the devnet as the full chain spec is yet to be implemented;
        * Devnet is alpha stage, it's not persistent and things might break;
        * We are progressively moving towards decentralization.
        

    </Step>
    <Step title="Testnet: upcoming">
        After the validation of the design and architecture during devnet, we aim to lock the chain spec and release a testnet. What can you expect during testnet:
        * Chain spec is completed and fully functional;
        * Biggest upgrade will be in bringing AI inference on the validator level so the network can achieve highest security and verifiability guarantees;
        * Testnet is incentivized so devs can already deploy the AI apps & agents which they want to go live during mainnet.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Mainnet: upcoming">
        Following the successful iterations and invaluable feedback garnered through our testnet phase, we will launch Galadriel's mainnet. What can you expect during launch of mainnet:
        * Stress testing, code frozen and security audits completed;
        * Expanding validator network;
        * Incentive programs for developers.
