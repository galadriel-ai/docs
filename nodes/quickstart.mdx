This quickstart covers:

1. Downloading & running an LLM on your machine
2. Downloading & intializing the node client
3. CLI commands to use the client

### Prerequisites

* Please see the [requirements](requirements)

### Run the GPU node (CLI)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    1. Create an account [here](https://dashboard.galadriel.com)
    2. Create an API key on the dashboard
    3. Create a node on the dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a virtual environment">
    For example, using venv
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install galadriel">
    ```bash
    pip install galadriel-node
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup the environment">
    Make sure to set the correct **API key** and **node-id** that you created on the dashboard.

    Other values should be the default ones.

    ```
    galadriel init
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the node">
    ```bash
    galadriel node run
    ```
    If this is your first time running the GPU node, it will perform hardware validation
    and LLM benchmarking, to ensure your setup is working correctly and is fast enough.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check node status">
    In another terminal tab:

    ```bash
    galadriel node status
    ```
    If the status is <span style={{color: "green"}}>online</span> you've successfully started your GPU node and it's
    serving LLM inference requests to the network.

  </Step>

</Steps>

### Checking node stats

Available if the GPU node is initialized and its status is <span style={{ color: "green" }}>online</span>.
```bash
galadriel node stats
```

### Checking network stats

Available if the GPU node is initialized and its status is <span style={{ color: "green" }}>online</span>.
```bash
galadriel network stats
```


### What's next?

* Get [rewards](incentives) for running the node and serving LLM inference to the network.
* Check out how to [update](update-node) the galadriel-node.
