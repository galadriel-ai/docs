import {oracleAddress, nonEnclaveOracleAddress} from '/snippets/addresses.mdx';

The current address of the oracle on Galadriel devnet is:

**{oracleAddress}**

{/*

This is the oracle provided by the Galadriel team, running in a [TEE](/how-it-works#tee). If you wish, you can set up your own: see [here](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/tree/main/oracles).

If the above oracle is not responding, you may want to use a secondary oracle in the development process. This secondary oracle does **not** run in a TEE. The address of that oracle is:

{nonEnclaveOracleAddress}
