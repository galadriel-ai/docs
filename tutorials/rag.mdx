title: "Retrieval-augmented generation"
---

In this tutorial, we'll enhance a ChatGPT-like chatbot with a knowledge base. The knowledge base will be used to retrieve relevant information that can be used to generate more informative and contextually relevant responses. This is also known as **retrieval-augmented generation** (RAG).

### Prerequisites

You can read this tutorial as-is to understand the basics of RAG with Galadriel. However, to deploy the contract and interact with it, you will need:

- A Galadriel devnet account. For more information on setting up a wallet, visit [Setting Up A Wallet](/setting-up-a-wallet).
- Some devnet tokens. Get your free devnet tokens from the [Faucet](/faucet).
