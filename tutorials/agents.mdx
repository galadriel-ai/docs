### Introduction

AI agents are a specific kind of AI application. They are mainly defined by two things: an LLM running in a **loop** and access to the external world via **tools**. An AI agent is in effect an LLM that is repeatedly asked to make a decision: given a user input and progress so far, what tool should we call next? This architecture has proven powerful and flexible, and is used for a variety of applications.

A common example is a researcher AI agent. Given tools for searching the web, browsing websites, and perhaps storing outputs in a scratch file, the agent assembles a report on a particular topic. At every point the LLM decides which tool to call next, given the progress it's had so far.

### Before agents: single LLM call

In this tutorial, our goal will be to create a simple agent that can create images based on live information, e.g. the current weather in the user's chosen location.

As the first step, let's create a contract that makes a single LLM call without any loop or external tools. Once we have that contract in place, we'll build on it until we have a complete agent.

TODO basically quickstart but with a single LLM call

### Making a loop
// Minimal loop, just LLM, no tool usage
// Demonstrate how it runs in a loop

### Adding a tool: web search
// Add one tool: web search
// Demonstrate the added capability: get weather

### Adding a tool: image generation
// Add a second tool: image gen
// Show what it can do now: generate image based on current image

### Complete agent
