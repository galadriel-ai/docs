On-chain AI enables building powerful products that combine the security of blockchains with the intelligence of state-of-the-art AI models.

In addition to the three fully functional dApps we've built (see sections below 👇), here are a few ideas for what Galadriel enables.

* Fast and low-cost oracle that brings off-chain data on-chain by using AI to source and verify the data.
* Investment agents that allocate a DAO's money based on the predictions of an LLM.
* On-chain content moderation that uses AI to filter out content that doesn't follow the platform's rules.
* Prediction market bots that use AI and web access to trade on prediction markets, especially ones too niche for most humans to do so.
* Evaluating work done on an on-chain freelancer marketplace.

Whatever you are building with Galadriel, we'd love to hear -- please reach out and share what you're working on!

### On-chain ChatGPT

This dApp looks familiar to most people and allows chatting to an AI model on-chain, and the conversation is stored on-chain as well.

### Generative AI NFT minter

This dApp combines the developer's prompt with the user input to make an NFT where the user has control over the final input, yet the NFT is recognizably part of the collection.
