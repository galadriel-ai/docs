title: [RAG]
---

You can add a knowledge base to your LLM app or agent. A knowledge base is broadly useful for including lots of information in the context -- information that is too long to always include in the prompt.

This technique, called **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, is a combination of a retriever and a generator. The retriever finds the relevant information from the knowledge base, and the generator uses this information to generate a response. In our case, the generator is an [LLM](/reference/llms), and as explained below, you can use a vector database through the Galadriel oracle as the retriever.

Before you can call any of the steps above, you need to:

1. Extract text from your documents (PDFs, books, websites, etc).
2. Upload the chunks to IPFS.
3. Request the oracle to index it.

We have provided a script that does this for you -- **follow the steps in [this README](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/contracts/tree/main/rag_tools)**; this is a prerequisite for your contract to be able to call the below methods.

After indexing your documents, you should have an IPFS CID representing your knowledge base (the above script provides this).
