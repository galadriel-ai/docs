# IMPORTANT
If you need to change the addresses of anything (deployed contracts, oracles, etc) -- please do so in `snippets/addresses.mdx`. All usages of these variables will then automatically change across all docs pages.

Similarly, if you're adding a new address or other value into the docs that is going to change relatively often, please also add it as a snippet.
