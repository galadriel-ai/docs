Galadriel is the first L1 for AI.

# What is Galadriel?

<b>Like Ethereum enabled writing smart contracts to build dApps, Galadriel enables developers to build AI apps & agents like smart contracts, which are decentralized and on-chain.</b> Whether that takes the shape of a simple LLM feature in a dApp, or highly capable AI agents ranging from on-chain AI hedge funds, in-game AI NPCs to genAI NFTs.

Galadriel is built on a parallel-execution EVM stack which enables high throughput, low-latency and has a familiar devexp for all the Solidity devs. It brings AI inference on-chain in a low-cost, low-latency manner through teeML (Trusted Execution Environment Machine Learning) implementation which allows to query any open and closed-source LLM models in a verifiable manner. 

In order to enable decentralized AI apps & agents which leverage both the native capabilities of AI and Web3 rails, a purpose built L1 had to be built. High-level overview of Galadriel L1 stack:

Note that all of the functionality in the stack is not live as Galadriel is in early testnet.

# What problem Galadriel solves?

<b>Today, all the AI applications you use are centralized, you lack ownership in them, or have any say in how they are governed.</b>

If you are a developer building AI apps or agents, the only option is to deploy them on a centralized stack. During the last OpenAI Dev Day, many developers felt rug pulled as OpenAI bundled their products into GPTs and an assistant API. All centralized AI providers come with a platform risk for devs because they compete against them and risk being shut down. In 2015, Ethereum gave devs a way to build without platform risk. Galadriel aims to do the same for building AI apps & agents where devs are the masters of their destiny. 

Secondly, AI is becoming the biggest wealth creator throughout human history, but if it is owned by handful of Web2 monopolies as of today, then the most likely outcome is extreme wealth disparity because of their extractive economic model. It is already happening today - OpenAI last valuation was $80B but all of the economical value has flown to approximately 600 people, counting the team and investors. AI should be owned by citizens not by a few large AI monopolies.

Thirdly, it seems no one is admitting the fact, but today, the fate of 8 billion people is in the hands of less than 100 people - boards of OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, etc. Simply ask: would you trust your or your family’s lives in the hands of Sam Altman? This is the broken safety model we have today where these oligopolists say to trust us, we can govern superintelligence once we invent it. Meanwhile, the man who promises to bring the world a safe AI can’t even govern his own company, as shown by the board hiatus. History has repeatedly shown that security through obscurity never works. Web3 rails is the most safe infotechnological infrastructure the humanity has invented so far - the proof is in the pudding as Bitcoin secures $1.3T and Ethereum 478B+ dollars as of 13.3.2024. Galadriel aims to bring large-scale deployment of AI on Web3 rails which can be governed in a transparent, democratic way.

<b>Galadriel's mission is to enable safe, citizen-owned AI by bringing devs the Ethereum of AI.</b>
