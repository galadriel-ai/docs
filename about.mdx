The goal of Galadriel is to enable on-chain, autonomous AI. Whether that takes the shape of a simple LLM feature in a dApp, or a complex and powerful on-chain AI agent, we aim to provide easy but powerful tools for making it happen.

To do so, we're making an L1 blockchain, purpose-built for AI. We aim to offer state-of-the-art models -- text-only and multimodal -- and all the supporting components needed for making practically useful AI apps. These include agent tools with internet access (like search engine), storage with semantic search, and much more.

Crucially, we believe the end-user experience should be close to off-chain AI apps, so we aim for minimal overhead in terms of latency and cost, relative to building off-chain AI applications. All of this may not seem feasible with today's technology, but we believe the combination of OPML, ZKML and other cutting-edge technology will rapidly make it so.
